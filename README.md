Hello everyone!
I am Sharuya Panthri, graduate student at CU ICAR, a platform to shape the future of the auto industry.
I intend to align my research and specialization with Autonomous Vehicles. 
I have developed a sensibility for the need for advanced technology using automated features for safer driving experience and greener energy solutions. 
This repository has files dealing with my course Autonomous Science and Systems Spring 2020.
